					The Dutch jazz saxophonist Candy Dulfer was five when she performed, together with her father and saxophonist Hans Dulfer, for the first time. During that performance, the way was paved for her worldwide success. Since then she has shared the stage with names like Prince, Van Morrison and Pink Floyd. And this year, album number sixteen appears. 
				</p>

					“Even when I was still in the cradle, I was surrounded by music and the saxophone. My father played a lot at home, and music was always present. If he was not playing, then there would be other music on. My parents had eclectic tastes in music. They played a lot of Jazz, but also other music, from Archie Shepp and Junior Walker to James Brown and Jimi Hendrix. But also Caribbean and African music. My mother loved pop music a great deal, like The Beatles and Bread. Everything was welcome, except Dixieland, I believe. The styles were all mixed together. Music cannot be divided into different genres. People always want to do that, but for me, music is music.
				</p>
				<p>
					“I was allowed to appear with my father on stage when I was four. He had a really great band then, with all Surinamese and Antillean musicians. I played along, for example, on the tambourine and percussion or sang along a bit. I already loved the stage then, even though I was very shy. After that I had a drum set for a weekend, but that was a bit too loud and not a great success. I was five when I was allowed to try the saxophone for the first time. I have been playing since that moment, really.
				</p>
				<p>
					“My father gave me one lesson once. He is also autodidactic, and I was very stubborn from an early age, so we were soon arguing about the notes. Then he said: ‘You know what, just go to the harmonie.’ I took music lessons there for four years; it was great fun! I earned my A diploma in music theory there, and after that I taught myself everything.
				</p>
				<p>
					“In October, my new album comes out. And then there are tours through Japan, Korea & America on the schedule. This year I’ll perform again at the North Sea Jazz festival. I really think it’s a great festival, and I’m proud that I will be there again. I first performed there when I was 12, and I am still grateful that Paul Acket and Rosa King gave me that chance. For me, North Sea is still Paul Acket, even though he passed away a long time ago. When I am there, I always get a bit emotional, and I think: ‘Well, he gave all of this to me, that dear man.’”
